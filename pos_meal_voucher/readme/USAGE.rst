If the amount received is too important, a warning icon is displayed

  .. figure:: ../static/description/front_ui_pos_payment_screen_summary.png

If the cashier try to validate the order, a warning is also display, asking confirmation

  .. figure:: ../static/description/front_ui_pos_payment_screen_warning.png

It is a non blocking warning, because we don't want to prevent an order to be done,
if products are not correctly set, or if a recent law changed the maximum amount that can
be used each day. (A recent case occured in France, during the Covid-19 pandemy)
